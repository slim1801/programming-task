Make sure you've got node and npm installed on your machine

If not, here is a quick link on how to https://nodejs.org/en/download

To pre-install dependencies run

```
npm install
```

To run the program

```
npm run start
```

To run test

```
npm run test
```

Assumptions:

- Definition of "URL" is a "web accessible" resource, so I've incorporated http/https check
- I've interpreted "Active IPs" as most visited ip that returns a valid response (2\*\*)
